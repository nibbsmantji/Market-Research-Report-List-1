<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Contract Catering Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>

<p><p>Contract catering services involve various pricing models. In a fixed price contract, clients pay a set fee for specified services, providing budget certainty and simplicity. This model is beneficial for predictable operations and cost management.
