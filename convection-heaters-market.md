<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Convection Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Convection Heater</li><li>Forced Convection Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The convection heaters market is primarily divided into two types: natural convection heaters and forced convection heaters. Natural convection heaters rely on the natural movement of warm air, which rises and circulates to distribute heat throughout a space. They are typically quieter and energy-efficient. In contrast, forced convection heaters use fans or blowers to enhance air circulation, delivering heat more rapidly and evenly. This type is ideal for larger spaces or where faster heating is required. Both types cater to various heating needs in residential and commercial sectors.</p></p>
